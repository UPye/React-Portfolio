I'm experienced in customer service, hospitality, valet, casino and hotel, restaurant, fast-food, retail, and department stores. I've also worked, and am working in the IT field, tech support, and warehousing. However, I have never really found a career path that challenges me on a daily basis, until I was introduced to learning my first coding language. Even though HTML and CSS are far from challenging, I felt like I found my calling in life, so I began to want to know more. First, I began at freecodecamp.org and many free learning to code apps; however, I was never disiplined enough to carve out time to study because there was always something life threw my way. When moving to Arkansas, I began wanting to know more about studying, so that's when I came across apprenticeships. I went through the steps with the Arkansas Workforce and Development office in Little Rock to begin the apprenticeship process. That's when I was enrolled in my first coding course at the University of Arkansas online called Creating Webpages. Believe me, I knew I was on my way to becoming a full on hacker from there. That's when I met the lovely Javascript, and this language definitely challenged me. DOM manipulation alone challenged me because I felt everything I learned and did was in vain. That's when I realized, Javascript synthax doesn't like me. However, by the time I enrolled in UCF's coding bootcamp, I was surrounded by a community of peers working towards the same goal, and they all played a viable part in me realizing Javascript runs the world. It always has and it always will, so I may as well learn it now."}),Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:"Once we got to API calls, I began thinking, what did I get myself into. I usually pick up things super fast, but coding always had something else planned time-wise around the corner. While working 40+ hours a week and being promoted, I also juggled coding 30+ hours a week. Even though I was on the part-time schedule, it felt like I was doing full-time. Working to complete 2 builds a week was the bain of my existence. That is until everything started to make since. All the languages we were learning week in and week out all worked together like some sort of huge puzzle. All the synthax followed the same format, with different synthax, no matter the language. That's when I realized coding is EXACTLY like math, as far as the way you think and work through the process of solving problems. You can get from point A to point B multiple ways, rather you're using PHP, React, Javascript, or any other laguage, the outcome will still be the same. On that day, I knew I would code for the rest of my life. That's when I began looking into career opportunities because something had to give. I was done bouncing from field to field to be apart of the highest bidder. I wanted to be apart of something larger than myself, and technology adds to the growth and development of life as we know it. Anyways, enough about my spill on how I came to love coding, and more about me."}),Object(c.jsxs)("p",{children:["I am a single woman without children, but I am the parent of a fur baby. I love trying new things, bowling, kayaking, and anything that can get my adrenaline going that isn't too dangerous. I would love to continue traveling and seeing the world, so I would love to work in a remote position. I also value paid time off, so after grueling projects or just a long run of projects, I may take a breather and not burn out. I also want to make at least $72K starting out, and I would like access to health/vision/dental insurance, short-term/ long-term disability, 401K matching (willing to negotiate up to limit), life insurance, and someone whom with I can still complete personal projects, without compromising the integrity of the company.
